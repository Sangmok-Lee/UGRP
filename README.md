# UGRP - Understanding of Computer Systems Security and Design of Secure Computer Systems
Undergraduate Group Research Project (Flush+Reload, Row-Hammering Detection Program)

Attacks which exploit hardware weakness such as Flush+Reload attack or Row-Hammering is serious security issue.
To avoid these kinds of attack fundamentally, the way the hardware work should be changed.
However, this kind of method will not be compatible with current computer systems.

Therefore, we decided to build a defense system that can be used on most of the computers in use today. In addition, we aimed to make our programs not only universal, but also capable of fast and accurate detection. 

Our program is based on Intel Performance Counter Monitor (PCM).
